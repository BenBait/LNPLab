The data that these repositories help analyze is in the form of an ASCII file
with pixel data for a grayscale movie.

Repo Descriptions
-----------------

O. bg_info, part_data: these contain data required for various calculations
    --> bg_info gives the background calculations done to find the best fit
        curve to model background noise
    --> part_data is a mixture of data gathered from the images, and then
        analysis done for individual particles

I. shift: contains method for finding the allignment equation between the 2
          spectral bands
          
II. get_boxes_raw: utilizes a c++ generated executable to calculate the 
                   intensities in specified regions. These regions of 
                   interest are used to get the brightness ratios

III. get_T: convert the ratio data into temperature data

IV. process_T: analyze the temperature data; perhaps the most illuminating
                graph is the number of particles required for the mean error
                to be less than 2 deg Celsius vs. the number of frames
